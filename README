DESCRIPTION
    WWW::TextMarks provides access to the TextMarks SMS Service V2 API.

    Currently, it only allows you to send text messages to individual
    subscribers. Eventually, it'll also allow you to maintain your
    subscriber list and perform the full set of tasks made available by the
    TextMarks API.

    Patches are welcome in case you get to it before I do. :-)

METHODS
  new
    See SYNOPSIS above for an example.

    Required: apik, user, pass, tm. Optional: url

    Setting the "url" is not recommended unless the embedded URL in this
    module fails to work properly or if you require an alternate URL
    provided by TextMarks.

    The "apik" is created by registering for an API key at:
    <http://www.textmarks.com/dev/api/reg/?ref=devapi>

    The "user" and "pass" is your TextMarks website login username and
    password. Your username is most likely your cell phone number.

  send
    See SYNOPSIS above for an example.

    The first argument is the SMS recipient's phone number. The second
    argument is the message to send. There are no other arguments.

    If you wish to send to many recipients, just call "send" multiple times,
    once per recipient.
